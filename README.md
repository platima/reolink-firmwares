# Reolink Firmware Collection

This repository contains firmware files for various Reolink camera models that I own. It serves as a personal archive for firmware versions, including both current and historical releases.

## Repository Structure

Firmware files are organized by camera model, with each model containing subdirectories for specific hardware variants:

```
<Camera Model>/
  <Hardware Model>/
    *.pak          # Firmware package files
    *.txt          # Release notes and changelogs (when available)
```

## Camera Models

- **E1 Outdoor** - 5MP WiFi PTZ Camera.
- **RLC-1240A** - 12MP Camera.
- **RLC-822A** - 8MP Auto-Focus Camera (IMX415 sensor).
- **RLC-811A** - 8MP Auto-Focus Camera (IMX415 sensor) with spotlight and 5x optical zoom.

## Firmware Sources

The firmware files in this collection come from various sources:

- **Reolink Support Emails** - Firmware provided directly by Reolink support team
- **r/reolinkcam Community** - Shared by community members on Reddit
- **AT0myks/reolink-fw-archive** - Files from the now-archived repository at https://github.com/AT0myks/reolink-fw-archive

## Notes

- Where available, `.txt` files with the same name as the firmware contain release notes, changelogs, or other relevant information
- Firmware files use the `.pak` or `.paks` extension and follow Reolink's naming convention
- Always verify firmware compatibility with your specific camera model and hardware version before updating

## Disclaimer

This is a personal collection for archival purposes. Always exercise caution when updating camera firmware and ensure you have a backup of your camera's configuration. Use these firmware files at your own risk.
